# Scientists can't code

Scientist do not always have a background in CS. This means that they often only have very basic knowledge of programmation. Because of this, it is not rare to see very bad code or even code that simply doesn't work in scientific articles. 

Science is not only about putting your findings out there, it is about making it possible for other people to reproduce it.
By having really bad code, it can make it very difficult for people to understand what you are doing and how you are doing it.

This repository takes bad code snippets from scientific articles and creates a more optimized and readable version.
The goal is to promote digital literacy as every person should be able to fact-check easily things that are put in front of them.
